Exploratory Analysis of Wildfire Date provided by the US Forest Service from 1992 - 2018

In this project we will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore geo-referenced wildfire data in the United States. Our goal is to get a better understanding of wildfires in the US. We want to explore the most common fire causes, where large fires are located in the country, what factors might contribute to their size, and how fires have changed over time.

We will predominantly use Matplotlib in order to visualize the relationships between fires and other variables in the dataset.
